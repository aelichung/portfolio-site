        <p>I’m Anne-Elise, a software programmer and a fan of MMO’s & immersive exploration. I would love the opportunity to work with and learn from the diverse and seasoned team at Gardens. </p>
        <p>I wouldn’t normally go very in-depth about my life in a job application but since the job description mentioned looking for “unusual backgrounds & diverse skill sets” here’s a bit about me. </p>
        <p>I was born in France (this isn’t my life story I promise), which inspired a love of cathedrals, the peaceful mountain countryside of the French Alps, bread, cheese, and croissants! </p>
        <p>In college, I studied architecture, staying up all night in studio to glue little pieces of wood together and pan around 3D models with my friends (not very sustainable, but memorable nonetheless). After graduating, I spent 2 years professionally designing hotels & restaurants. My biggest takeaways from architecture were the team experiences of turning ideas into physical realities, as well as an appreciation for how environments can tell stories and inspire emotions.</p>
        <p>From architecture, I shifted into crafting digital spaces. I began creating interactive AR & VR prototypes for an industrial design company. I’ve made AR tissue boxes, realistic virtual bathrooms, airplane interiors, etc. I also helped to design and develop a VR design review tool for mining engineers.</p>
        <p>My work in XR exposed me to Unity & C# and I’ve been focused on honing my technical skills ever since. I started taking computer science classes while working full time. I joined absurd:joy as a software developer where I worked on a gamified remote co-working app called Tangle.</p>
        <p>I’ve been working on Tangle for the past 2+ years, gaining mastery in C#, creating robust systems, multiplayer networking, and agile workflows. I’ve really enjoyed developing the joyful, collaborative experience that is Tangle and I hope to get the chance to continue that kind of work at Gardens!</p>
        <p>I’ve worn many hats throughout my career and I could not have done it without good communication, endless curiosity, and an eagerness to grow and learn from those around me. I’m the next gardener your team needs and I’m a decent plant mom too.</p>

        <p>Thanks and hope to hear from you soon!</br>Anne-Elise </br>
        <p>P.S. The concept art on your site is beautiful! It gives me Nausicaa and Moebius vibes, and I dig it.</p>
